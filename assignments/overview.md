# NOTES

As a side-effect, a default-construted ICUTokenizer discovers the sentences in a document by delimiting them with the sentence boundary tags.

In MeTA, classes that consume a token stream and emit a document representation are called Analyzers.

MeTA also has a natural language processing (NLP) component, which currently supports two major NLP tasks: part-of-speech (POS) tagging and syntactic parsing
